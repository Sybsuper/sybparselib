# Syb's Parser Library


### Credits
Heavily inspired by [uu-tc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uu-tc); Haskell 98 parser combinators for INFOB3TC at Utrecht University.
With the breaking api change that api functions like `listOf`, `natural`, and thus also `integer` now use `greedy` instead of `many`.
